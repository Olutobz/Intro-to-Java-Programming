# Intro-to-Java-Programming
>I've started my journey on a new java programming book, let's see how fun and challenging it will get.
This basically contains my solutions to the Programming Exercises in Introduction to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version (10th Edition) by Y. Daniel Liang (Author).
I chose this book because it was well recommended by other experienced java developers, it will also help me cover some loop holes I still have in java and subsequently 
it will help sharpen my data structures and algorithms knowledge.

## Getting Started
>Get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
>Do note that each exercise was solved within the scope of new terminologies introduced in each chapters, so it's 
a good guide for progressive study.

>Happy Coding!!!
