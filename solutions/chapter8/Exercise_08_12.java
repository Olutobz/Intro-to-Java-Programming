 * (Financial application: compute tax) Rewrite Listing 3.5, ComputeTax.java,     *
 * using arrays. For each filing status, there are six tax rates. Each rate is    *
 * applied to a certain amount of taxable income. For example, from the taxable   *
 * income of $400,000 for a single filer, $8,350 is taxed at 10%, (33,950 - 8,350)*
 * at 15%, (82,250 - 33,950) at 25%, (171,550 - 82,550) at 28%, (372,550 - 82,250)*
 * at 33%, and (400,000 - 372,950) at 36%. The six rates are the same for all     *
 * filing statuses, which can be represented in the following array:              *
 *                                                                                *
 * double[] rates = {0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.28, 0.33, 0.35};                         *
 *                                                                                *
 * The brackets for each rate for all the filing statuses can be represented in a *
 * two dimensional array as follows:                                              *
 * int[][] brackets = {                                                           *
 *     {8350, 33950, 82250, 171550, 372950},  // Single filer                       *
 *     {16700, 67900, 137050, 20885, 372950}, // Married jointly                    *
 * 	                                        // -or qualifying widow(er)           *
 *     {8350, 33950, 68525, 104425, 186475},  // Married separately                 *
 *     {11950, 45500, 117450, 190200, 372950} // Head of household                  *
 *  };                                                                            *
 *                                                                                *
 * Suppose the taxable income is $400,000 for single filers. The tax can be       *
 * computed as follows:                                                           *
 *                                                                                *
 * tax = brackets[0][0] * rates[0] +                                              *
 * 	 (brackets[0][1] – brackets[0][0]) * rates[1] +                               *
 * 	 (brackets[0][2] – brackets[0][1]) * rates[2] +                               *
