(Financial application: calculate interest) If you know the balance and the annual
percentage interest rate, you can compute the interest on the next monthly payment
using the following formula:
interest = balance * (annualInterestRate/1200)
Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and
displays the interest for the next month.
