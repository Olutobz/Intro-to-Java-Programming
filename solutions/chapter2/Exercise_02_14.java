/*
(Health application: computing BMI) Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of
health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and
dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the
user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. Note
that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters.
