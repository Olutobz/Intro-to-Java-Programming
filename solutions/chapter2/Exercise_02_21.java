/*
(Financial application: calculate future investment value) Write a program that
reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and displays
the future investment value using the following formula:
							futureInvestmentValue =
		investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^numberOfYears*12
For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number
of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98.
