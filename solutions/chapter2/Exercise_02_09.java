/*
(Physics: acceleration) Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity
divided by the time taken to make the change, as shown in the following formula:
                                  v1 - v0
                             a = ---------
                                     t
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity v0 in meters/
second, the ending velocity v1 in meters/second, and the time span t in seconds,
and displays the average acceleration.
