Adapted by SleekPanther from SquirrelCoder's initial idea from 29-Jan-17.
Uses arrays, even though they technically aren't introduced until chapter 7. But it simplifies this a lot

6.34 (Print calendar) Programming Exercise 3.21 uses Zeller's congruence to calculate
the day of the week. Simplify Listing 6.12, PrintCalendar.java, using Zeller's
algorithm to get the start day of the month.


Exercise 3.21 details
(Science: day of the week) Zeller's congruence is an algorithm developed by
Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is:
h=(q + (26(m+1))/10 + k + k/4 + j/4 +5*j)%7
h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday).
q is the day of the month.
m is the month (3: March, 4: April, ..., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
j is the century (i.e. year/100)
k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100).

Note that the division in the formula performs an integer division. Write a program
that prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month, and
displays the name of the day of the week.
(Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so you need
to convert the user input 1 to 13 and 2 to 14 for the month and change the year to the previous year.)
