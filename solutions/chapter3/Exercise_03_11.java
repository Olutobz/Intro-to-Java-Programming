/*
(Find the number of days in a month) Write a program that prompts the user
to enter the month and year and displays the number of days in the month. For
example, if the user entered month 2 and year 2012, the program should display
that February 2012 had 29 days. If the user entered month 3 and year 2015, the
program should display that March 2015 had 31 days.
