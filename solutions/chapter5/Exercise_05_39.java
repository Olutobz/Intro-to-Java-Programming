(Financial application: find the sales amount) You have just started a sales job
in a department store. Your pay consists of a base salary and a commission. The
base salary is $5,000. The scheme shown below is used to determine the commission
rate.

			Sales Amount                   Commission Rate
			------------------------------------------------
			$0.01–$5,000                     8 percent
			$5,000.01–$10,000               10 percent
			$10,000.01 and above            12 percent

Note that this is a graduated rate. The rate for the first $5,000 is at 8%, the next
$5000 is at 10%, and the rest is at 12%. If the sales amount is 25,000, the commission
is 5,000 * 8% + 5,000 * 10% + 15,000 * 12% = 2,700.

Your goal is to earn $30,000 a year. Write a program that finds the minimum sales
you have to generate in order to make $30,000.
