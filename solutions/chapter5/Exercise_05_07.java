(Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose that the tuition for a university
is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. In one year, the tuition
will be $10,500. Write a program that computes the tuition in ten years and the
total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition after the tenth year.
