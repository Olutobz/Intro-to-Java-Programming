(Financial application: compute CD value) Suppose you put $10,000 into a CD
with an annual percentage yield of 5.75%. After one month, the CD is worth

				10000 + 10000 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10047.92

After two months, the CD is worth

				10047.91 + 10047.91 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10096.06

After three months, the CD is worth

				10096.06 + 10096.06 * 5.75 / 1200 = 10144.44

and so on.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount (e.g., 10000), the
annual percentage yield (e.g., 5.75), and the number of months (e.g., 18) and
displays a table as shown in the sample run.
