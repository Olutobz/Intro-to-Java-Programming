/*
(Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month
into a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%. So, the monthly interest
rate is 0.05 / 12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account becomes

					100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417

After the second month, the value in the account becomes

					(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252

After the third month, the value in the account becomes

					(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507

and so on.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount (e.g., 100), the annual
interest rate (e.g., 5), and the number of months (e.g., 6) and displays the amount
in the savings account after the given month.
