/*
 * (Game: locker puzzle) A school has 100 lockers and 100 students. All lockers
 * are closed on the first day of school. As the students enter, the first
 * student, denoted S1, opens every locker. Then the second student, S2,
 * begins with the second locker, denoted L2, and closes every other locker.
 * Student S3 begins with the third locker and changes every third locker (closes
 * it if it was open, and opens it if it was closed). Student S4 begins with
 * locker L4 and changes every fourth locker. Student S5 starts with L5 and
 * changes every fifth locker, and so on, until student S100 changes L100.
 *
 * After all the students have passed through the building and changed the
 * lockers, which lockers are open? Write a program to find your answer and
 * display all open locker numbers separated by exactly one space.
 * (Hint: Use an array of 100 Boolean elements, each of which indicates whether a
 * locker is open (true) or closed (false). Initially, all lockers are closed.)
